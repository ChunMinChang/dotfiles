## Session Transcript Sync

This machine has `claude-session-sync` for archiving session transcripts.

### At Session End
Before ending a session (when the user says goodbye, thanks, or the task is clearly done), ask:
> "Would you like me to sync this session transcript? Provide a destination directory and I'll run `claude-session-sync export-current <dest>`."

If the user declines or provides an invalid path, leave the session unsynced. Do not ask repeatedly.

### At Session Start
Run `claude-session-sync status --project-filter ~/Work` silently. If there are unsynced sessions, mention it once briefly:
> "Note: N unsynced Claude sessions found. Run `claude-session-sync sync-all <dest>` to export them."
