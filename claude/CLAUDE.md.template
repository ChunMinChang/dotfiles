## Session Transcript Sync

This machine has `claude-session-sync` for archiving session transcripts.

If `$CLAUDE_TRANSCRIPT_DIR` is set, commands use it as the default destination.

### At Session End
Before ending a session (when the user says goodbye, thanks, or the task is clearly done), ask:
> "Would you like me to sync this session transcript? I'll run `claude-session-sync export-current`."

If `$CLAUDE_TRANSCRIPT_DIR` is not set, ask for a destination directory. If the user declines, leave the session unsynced. Do not ask repeatedly.

### At Session Start
Run `claude-session-sync status` silently. If there are unsynced sessions, mention it once briefly:
> "Note: N unsynced Claude sessions found. Run `claude-session-sync sync-all` to export them."
